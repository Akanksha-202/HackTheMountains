## üí° Inspiration
PCOS is one of the very common health condition we can witness these years. Despite being one of the most common endocrine disorders, PCOS receives less than .1% of   funding from the National Institutes of Health. Many people don't even know what exactly PCOS is and sometimes this can cause neglection towards the disorder. Mental   and physical, both conditions are hampered during PCOS which needs to be taken good care of.
Ovarian is one stop solution to all these problems lying in the way. It behaves as the Virtual Friend, whom you can talk to and who will give you the best advice possible.

## üåê Best Use of Velo by Wix

I have build a website using Velo by Wix. Wix Velo is a full-stack development platform that allows you to build a website from scratch, without any coding knowledge. It is a great tool for beginners who want to learn how to code, and for experienced developers who want to build a website quickly. Using Velo we can build a website in a matter of minutes, and we can also add custom JavaScript code to the website to make it more interactive. And we are using the following features of Wix

- **Wix Data**: We are using Wix Data to store the data in the database, and we can also use it to retrieve the data from the database.
- **Wix Users**: We are using Wix Users to add the user functionality to the website, and we can also use it to add the user functionality to the store.
- **Wix Media**: We are using Wix Media to add the media functionality to the website, and we can also use it to add the media functionality to the store.
- **Wix Payments**: We are using Wix Payments to add the payment functionality to the website, and we can also use it to add the payment functionality to the store.
- **Wix Analytics**: We are using Wix Analytics to add the analytics functionality to the website, and we can also use it to add the analytics functionality to the store.

## üß† Challenges we ran into

- Completing the project was a challenge because we had to implement the project in a deadline.
- As we are new to Wix, we had to learn how to use it.
- We had to learn how to use the Wix Velo platform.
